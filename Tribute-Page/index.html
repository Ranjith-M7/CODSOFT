        <p class="left-content-text"><strong>Optimus Prime</strong>, also known in Japan as <strong>Convoy</strong>,<span><sup>[a]</sup></span> is a fictional character and the
          protagonist of the <span>Transformers</span> franchise. The Transformers characters were developed for an American market
          after <span>Hasbro</span> representatives visited the 1983 Tokyo Toy Show.<span><sup>[3]</sup></span> The characters were modified and the coloring
          was changed; notably, Optimus Prime was colored red, chrome, and dark blue. The popularity of the Transformers
          toys resulted in comics, movies, and even a TV series.
          <br><br>
          In the Transformers mythology, Optimus Prime is a Cybertronian, an extraterrestrial species of sentient
          self-configuring modular <span>robotic</span> lifeforms (e.g.: cars and other objects), a blend of biological evolution and
          technological engineering. In almost every version of the mythos, Optimus is the leader of the <span>Autobots</span> , a
          faction of Transformers who are rivals of another faction, the <span>Decepticons</span>. He is defined by his strong <span>moral character</span> and is almost always portrayed as the primary <span>hero</span> of the story, opposing the Decepticon leader
          <span>Megatron</span>.
          <br><br>
          Over the history of the Transformers franchise, Optimus Prime has been portrayed by a variety of actors such
          as <span>Peter Cullen, Garry Chalk, Neil Kaplan, David Kaye,</span> and <span>Alan Tudyk</span>. </p><br>
